Welcome to my digital portfolio. My name is Yanelin and I'm a fullstack software engineer based in Tampa, FL. I've built this responsive portfolio website to showcase my work and skills as a developer. As in life, I am expecting my portfolio to transform and grow with every new programming experience and tech opportunity I come across starting today and into the near future. Feel free to look around and view some of my latest project. 

I look forward to connecting soon!
